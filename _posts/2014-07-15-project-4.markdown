description: High mountain environments generally reach higher degrees of naturalness and are exposed to fewer direct human impacts than lowlands, show high habitat variation over short distances, but are often strongly fragmented. A number of studies in European mountain ranges found rapid directional shifts in plant species compositions of alpine communities and increasing species numbers in synchrony with rising temperatures, thus corroborating the expectation of a high sensitivity of mountain floras to climatic changes.
