            <p class="para">
                The Department of Earth and Atmospheric
                Science is set up to provide state of the art
                education and research in earth, climate and
                ocean sciences. Earth and Atmospheric Science
                is a strongly interdisciplinary subject which links
                different resources (e. g. minerals, energy and
                water), natural hazards, environmental issues,
                and also serves as a significant relation to
                weather and climate, which is inevitable for
                human life and our society. The department
                would focus on the exploration of economically
                important mineral and energy resources,
                evolution and internal dynamics of Earth,
                surficial processes, natural & human-induced
                hazards, environmental issues, weather and
                climate and air quality modelling.
