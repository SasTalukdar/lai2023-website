                    The Department of Earth and Atmospheric
                    Science is set up to provide state of the art
                    education and research in earth, climate and
                    ocean sciences. Earth and Atmospheric Science
                    is a strongly interdisciplinary subject which links
                    different resources (e. g. minerals, energy and
                    water), natural hazards, environmental issues,
                    and also serves as a significant relation to
                    weather and climate, which is inevitable for
                    human life and our society. The department
                    would focus on the exploration of economically
                    important mineral and energy resources,
                    evolution and internal dynamics of Earth,
                    surficial processes, natural & human-induced
                    hazards, environmental issues, weather and
                    climate and air quality modelling.
